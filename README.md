Aloha Apparel V2 - RED ACADEMY: Project 1.5

Project Summary

This was the second part of the first project completed as a part of RED ACADEMY's front-end web developer program. Our goal was, using the basic foundation build previously, to replace all instances of floats with flexboxes and add jQuery functionality to the images.
The site was built to be responsive by implementing a mobile first design.

Languages and tools used:

HTML
CSS (with a CSS reset styles, and media queries
Mobile first approach to design & coding (Responsive Web Design)
Git
JQuery
flexboxes

What did I learn?

This project was my second opportunity to exercise the HTML and CSS skills taught throughout the first two weeks of web development training. Having comppleted the first part using floats gave me a greater appreciation of the functionality of flexbox. Also, I learned how relativly easy it is to use jQuery plug-ins to achieve certain results.
